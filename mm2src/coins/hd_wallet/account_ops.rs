///
/// Defines operations associated with an HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) account.
/// In the context of BIP-44 derivation paths, an HD account corresponds to the third level (`account'`)
/// in the structure `m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / chain (or change) / address_index`.
/// This allows for segregating funds into different accounts under the same seed,
/// with each account having multiple chains (often representing internal and external addresses).
///
/// Implementors of this trait should provide details about such HD account like its specific derivation path, known addresses, and its index.
